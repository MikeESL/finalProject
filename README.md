# finalProject
Final Project for the Iron Yard Academy: An application that allows registered users to post their personal ghost stories/experiences, with AngularJS and Firebase.

The idea for this application is based on observed consumer demand from past years spent as a city of Charleston tour guide.

App includes a real-time recent posts feed, a photo upload using a custom Angular directive, user log-in, search by city using Angular filter, mobile responsive with Twitter Bootstrap and media queries.
